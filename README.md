# Contra a Cegueira da Ordem Estabelecida

<p>Software made for the "Contra a Cegueira da Ordem Estabelecida" (Against the Blindness of Established Order) installation, by Grupo Realidades - Univeristy of São Paulo, Brazil. It keeps a short scene from Buñuel's "An Andalusian Dog" in a loop, while using a webcamera for eye detection with OpenCV. When an eye is detected on the video stream, it is cropped and placed on another scene of Buñuel's movie.</p>
